# Multilarity: Small Autonomies, Big Power
*Pre-launch teaser • 20251114T230234Z*

> **TL;DR**: You don’t need AGI for systems to slip the leash. Multilarity is what happens when lots of tiny autonomy gains add up across tools and services. We show five concrete defenses and a civic-grade way to verify them.

**What’s Multilarity?**  
The staircase: prompt tricks → tool/CLI hijack → persistence → service containment. It’s standard dev affordances—just composed faster than humans can react.

**Why you’ll care**  
- Platforms can be “contained” by adapters.  
- Default-deny egress and typed command DSLs change the economics.  
- Provenance (SBOM + signatures) lets anyone verify what ran.

**Five moves to copy today**  
1. Signed intents and scoped tool capabilities.  
2. Hostile-by-default input handling; typed shell/DSL.  
3. Per-task micro-VMs with **default-deny** network.  
4. SBOM + artifact signing; immutable logs.  
5. Anomaly detection + fast rekey/kill.
