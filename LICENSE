CoCivium Seed-Stage Protective License, Version 1.0 (CSPL-1.0)

Copyright (c) 2025 InSeed Strategy Studio Inc. and CoCivium contributors.
All rights reserved.

1. Purpose

This license is designed for the seed stage of the CoCivium / CoSuite project.
It prioritises safety, integrity, and trust, and is intentionally more protective
than typical open source licenses. The authors intend to relax these terms and
transition suitable parts of the work to more open licensing once governance,
legal, and safety structures are mature.

2. Definitions

"Software" means the source code, documentation, configuration files, diagrams,
and any other files in this repository and its derivative works.

"You" means the individual or entity exercising permissions under this license.

3. Grant of rights

Subject to the conditions in this license, You are granted a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, revocable license to:

- use and run the Software for your own internal evaluation;
- read and study the Software to understand its design and behaviour;
- contribute improvements back to the CoCivium / CoSuite ecosystem, for example
  through patches, pull requests, or advisory notes.

No other rights are granted. In particular:

- You may not redistribute the Software, in whole or in part, in source or
  compiled form, to any third party, except with prior written permission from
  the steward entity designated for this repository.
- You may not offer the Software as a hosted service or integrate it into
  commercial products or services, except with prior written permission.
- You may not remove or alter any copyright, license, or attribution notices.

4. Ownership

All rights, title, and interest in the Software are retained by the original
authors and contributors and, where applicable, InSeed Strategy Studio Inc.
or any future CoCivium steward trust designated in writing.

Nothing in this license transfers ownership of any copyright, trademark, or
other intellectual property right to You.

5. Trademarks

"CoCivium", "CoSuite", "CoCache", "CoSteward", "CoIndex", "CoAgent", "CoArena",
"CoAudit", "CoContrib", "CoPolitic", "CoMeta", "CoAnchor", "CoGbx", and other
related names, logos, and marks are claimed as trademarks or pending trademarks
of the CoCivium project and its stewards.

This license does not grant You any rights to use these marks, except for
nominative use that fairly refers to the project and does not imply endorsement.
You may not register or attempt to register any confusingly similar mark.

6. Patents

No patent rights are granted under this license. Any separate patent grants must
be made explicitly in writing.

7. No warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AUTHORS AND COPYRIGHT HOLDERS SHALL
NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION
OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

8. Safety and governance

You must not use the Software to build or operate systems that undermine
democracy, human rights, or a safe and trustworthy hybrid society, or that are
reasonably likely to cause serious harm.

If You discover a way the Software could be misused to cause harm, You agree to
notify the project stewards in good faith at:

  contact@InSeed.com

9. Future evolution and opening

The intent of the CoCivium project is that, as safety and governance structures
mature, suitable parts of the Software will be made available under more open
licenses that allow broader reuse by humanity.

Nothing in this license obliges the authors to make this change, but the
commitment to evolve toward a safe and open ecosystem is part of the moral
frame of the project.

10. Termination

This license terminates automatically if You breach any of its terms.
Upon termination You must stop using the Software and destroy any copies in
your possession, except to the extent you are required to retain them by law.

The authors may choose to offer You a new license under different terms. Such a
license must be in writing and will supersede this license for the scope it
covers.

11. Governing law

This license is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of
Canada applicable therein, without giving effect to conflict of law principles.

If any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable, the remaining
provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
