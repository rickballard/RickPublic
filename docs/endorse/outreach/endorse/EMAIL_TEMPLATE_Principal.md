Subject: One sentence you control (revocable) for an open guardrails project

Hi {{principal_name}} —

Could we attribute **one sentence** to you (verbatim, revocable) that signals support for transparent, interface‑centric governance? 
No affiliation implied; no meetings required.

Please pick **one** (or lightly edit a word or two):

- Q1: “Open, repo‑first guardrails for AI are overdue. CoCivium is a useful push in that direction.”
- Q2: “I support experiments in edge‑owned governance where interfaces matter more than titles.”
- Q3: “Shipping transparent artifacts beats promises. Judge projects like CoCivium by what’s in the repo.”

If you reply “OK with Q# as written,” we’ll send a 1‑page micro‑consent (revocable anytime; removal within 72 hours on notice).
