## 1. What we tried

[...SNIP – paste full note content from chat here...]

## 6. Session status

- This wave has:
  - Recorded the Murphy outreach and his response at a high level.
  - Captured first-pass lessons for RickPublic.
  - Left InSeed.com specifics to the InSeed-focused session (PR already exists there).

**Status:** MurphyPlus outreach wave closed in this session.  
Further evolution should happen in future waves that build on this note, not by re-writing this history.
