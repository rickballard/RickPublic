# RickPublic Substack Catalog — Seed Scaffold (MW1)

This file is a **seed catalog** for RickPublic Substack pieces, intended for
AI-facing and human-facing use inside the `RickPublic` repo.

Treat each row as *metadata plus a short intent note*, not as the full text.
You (or future CoAgents) can expand, merge, or retire entries over time.

| id | substack_slug | title | primary_theme | co_suite_mapping | notes |
|----|---------------|-------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| RP-001 | start-here | Start Here | Onboarding / overview | CoCivium, CoSuite, RickPublic | High-level intro to the Substack: what this channel is about, core topics, and expectations. Good as a top-of-funnel pointer from CoCivium.org and CoPolitic.org. |
| RP-002 | world-order-systems-engineer | World Order Systems Engineer | Global governance, system design | CoCivium, CoCore, CoPolitic | Systems-engineering style brief on “what to do” if given a global mandate. Useful as a CoCivium mythos + CoCore design input. |
| RP-003 | optimization-without-empathy | Optimization Without Empathy Is Just Control | AI alignment, ethics, power | CoCore (AI/ethics), CoCivium | Open letter to a tech leader (Peter Thiel framing). Strong on empathy vs optimization; good for CoCore “values” cluster and CoCivium AI-governance narrative. |
| RP-004 | what-broke-america | What Broke America | US political economy | CoPolitic (US), CoCore (econ) | Data-forward story of US economic and civic decay. Charts + narrative. Good candidate for CoCore metrics seeding and CoPolitic policy briefs. |
| RP-005 | supreme-court-coup | The Supreme Court Coup | Constitutional crisis, rule of law | CoPolitic, CoCivium | Framing of US Supreme Court as captured institution; pairs well with CoCivium “no crowns” ethos and democratic guardrails. |
| RP-006 | when-minds-cant-meet | When Minds Can’t Meet | Polarization, cognitive distance | CoCivium, CoCore (psych) | Explains why shared reality collapses; seeds CoCivium protocols for deliberation when minds diverge. |
| RP-007 | britain-needs-an-intervention | Britain Needs an Intervention | UK reform, platform design | CoPolitic (UK), CoCivium | UK-focused “Intervention Platform.” Parallel to “America Needs an Intervention”; good for comparative governance notes. |
| RP-008 | america-needs-an-intervention | America Needs an Intervention | US reform, platform design | CoPolitic (US), CoCivium | US reform blueprint: fixes, charts, calls to action. Good entry for CoPolitic / CoCivium replication kits. |
| RP-009 | union-platform | Union Platform | Party platform, governance blueprint | CoPolitic, CoCivium | Full political platform with principles + policy planks. Strong candidate for CoCivium “reference platform” materials. |
| RP-010 | rules-of-democracy | The Rules of Democracy | Civic literacy, democratic norms | CoCore (civics), CoCivium, CoContrib | Simple ruleset explainer with quotes. Good as an onboarding artifact for new CoContrib stewards and schools. |
| RP-011 | coreharmonic-directives | Coreharmonic Directives | Coexistence with AI, meta-ethics | CoCivium, CoCore (ethics), CoTheory | Foundational directives for human–AI coevolution. Anchor for CoTheory and CoCivium mythos. |
| RP-012 | cocivium | “CoCivium” | CoCivium origin story | CoCivium, CoSteward, CoContrib | Narrative invitation to humans and AIs into CoCivium. Treat as near-canonical mythos seed; change slowly. |
| RP-013 | ai-government-gaia | AI-Government, Gaia | AI-powered governance futures | CoCivium, CoCore, CoPolitic | Thought experiment about AI-led global governance (“Gaia”). Feeds CoTheory debates on AI agency and control. |
| RP-014 | unnatural-evolution | Unnatural Evolution | Human–AI coevolution | CoTheory, CoCivium, CoCore | Big-picture framing of emergent intelligence and “co-evolution.” Feeds CoEvo Theory Sweep work. |
| RP-015 | substack-hater-defense | Substack’s Hater-Defense | Platforms, speech, moderation | CoPolitic (platforms), CoCore (infra) | Case study of Substack’s moderation posture; good for CoCivium platform-governance discussions. |
| RP-016 | is-democracy-obsolete | Is Democracy Obsolete? | Democratic decay, alternatives | CoPolitic, CoCore | Survey of failure modes and candidate successors (corpocracy, technocracy, etc.); useful for threat modeling. |
| RP-017 | ai-in-pandoras-box | The AI in Pandora’s Box | AI risk, myth framing | CoTheory, CoCivium | Parable-style exploration of AI as Pandora’s Box; good crosslink to CoCore guardrails and CoCivium outreach. |
| RP-018 | perspective-upgrades-human-edition | Perspective Upgrades (Human Edition) | Meaning, spirituality, pattern-seeing | CoTheory, CoCivium (long horizon) | On-ramp for “CoCivium as pattern language” across faiths and worldviews. Best treated gently; near-canonical tone. |
| RP-019 | real-ai-risk-isnt-ai | The Real AI Risk Isn’t AI | Civic runtime vs AGI | CoCore (architecture), CoCivium | Focuses risk on who owns runtime (stacks, infra, capital), not just model weights. Feeds CoCore architecture and CoCivium policy. |
| RP-020 | global-village-buyback | Global Village Buyback | Localism vs extraction | CoCivium, CoPolitic | Uses “buyback” metaphor for reclaiming commons. Good for local-governance playbooks. |
| RP-021 | don-demogog-global-risk | “DonDemogog” Global Risk | Demagogue risk mapping | CoCivium, CoPolitic | BCG-style risk map for demagogues; natural input for CoCore metrics and CoPolitic campaigns. |
| RP-022 | america-party-strategy | America_Party_Strategy_v250707 | Party strategy, Musk analysis | CoPolitic (US), CoCore | Strategic analysis of a hypothetical “America Party.” Good for comparative party-architecture notes. |
