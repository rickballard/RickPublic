# Newsletter_Reframe_ProductPlan_v1.0

## Vision
RickPublic becomes the subscription newsletter that **reframes** mass‑market headlines and reveals the incentives behind them. The product serves readers who value **wisdom over outrage**.

## Editorial Unit
Per story:
1. **Original** (one line): the widely circulating headline.
2. **Reframe** (one line): the accurate, bias‑aware rewrite.
3. **Bullets** (3–5): snack‑size, specific, falsifiable, link‑backed.
4. **The Real Story** (short paragraph) when needed.
5. **Congruence strip** (CoCivium halo icons) with compact legend link.
6. **Sources**: 2–5 citations (diverse; contrasting editorial lines).

## Ratings (icons)
- Truthfulness (green→amber→red)
- Source bias (low → medium → high)
- Intent (inform | sell | outrage | op‑ed | tribal | astroturf)
- Ethics (fairness / privacy / manipulation)

## Frequency
- Start weekly; target 3×/week.

## Pipeline
- Fetch → cluster → reframe → ethics review → editor pass → publish → feedback apply.

## Distribution & Growth
- Substack email + web; short social teasers (“Original vs Reframe”).
- Praise exemplars (even when we disagree) to model good practice.
- Invite reader challenges; award “wisdom score” for constructive input.

## KPIs
- Open rate, CTR on “Reframe” links, read time, feedback acceptance rate, exemplar clicks, unsubscribe delta after controversial issues.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Dogma risk**: Show dissenting sources; keep bullets falsifiable.
- **Overlength**: Firm 5–10 min reads; deep dives as linked posts.
- **Automation drift**: Ethics threshold gating and alerting.
