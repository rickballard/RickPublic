**GitHub org/repo:** compdemocracy/*

## Why candidate
- Opinion‑space clustering at population scale; proven in vTaiwan and other civic deployments.
- High alignment with consensus‑finding and deliberative pipelines.
- Natural bridge: Pol.is export → AdviceBomb → CoAudit → narrative explainers.

## Who to approach
- Founders/Leads include Colin Megill; engage via org email and GitHub discussions.
- Contacts: email: hello@compdemocracy.org

## First-touch (ready-to-file)
**Issue title:** Bridge: Pol.is exports → AdviceBomb (auditable deliberation → action)

**Issue body (drop-in):**
Offer a minimal script and schema mapping from Pol.is CSV/JSON exports into AdviceBomb ZIPs with CoVerify checks and CoSync notes.

See `/templates/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` for a richer scaffold.

## Positioning notes
- Emphasize repo‑first, checksumed artifacts and zero lock‑in.
- Offer a tiny PR/docs-only change first; code adapters optional.
- Mention CoAudit verifiability and CoSync breadcrumbs.
