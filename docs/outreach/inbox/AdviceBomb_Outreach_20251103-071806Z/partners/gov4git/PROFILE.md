# Gov4Git Foundation — Dossier

**GitHub org/repo:** gov4git/*

## Why candidate
- Git‑native decentralized governance; perfectly matches 'repo = source of truth'.
- Rapidly evolving releases and clear maintainer presence.
- Potential: a CoSuite governance module using Gov4Git for proposals/votes/merges on AdviceBomb workflows.

## Who to approach
- Founder/maintainer Petar Maymounkov is active across repos and Medium posts.
- Contacts: email: petar@gov4git.org

## First-touch (ready-to-file)
**Issue title:** Module: AdviceBomb governance with Gov4Git (git‑native votes)

**Issue body (drop-in):**
Contribute a minimal governance module where proposals/votes/credits link to AdviceBomb artifacts and CoAudit verifications.

See `/templates/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` for a richer scaffold.

## Positioning notes
- Emphasize repo‑first, checksumed artifacts and zero lock‑in.
- Offer a tiny PR/docs-only change first; code adapters optional.
- Mention CoAudit verifiability and CoSync breadcrumbs.
