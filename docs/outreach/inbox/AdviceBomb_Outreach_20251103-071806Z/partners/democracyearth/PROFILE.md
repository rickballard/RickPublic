# Democracy Earth Foundation  -  Dossier

**GitHub org/repo:** DemocracyEarth/*

## Why candidate
- Pioneer in crypto/identity/voting; some modules can be profiled for 'Civic‑not‑Crypto' contexts.
- Potential module swap: replace wallets with attestation/identity providers, keep verifiability.

## Who to approach
- Suggest a 'Civic‑not‑Crypto' profile as an optional path in their repos; ask for feedback.
- Contacts: website: https://democracy.earth/

## First-touch (ready-to-file)
**Issue title:** Profile: Civic‑not‑Crypto (attestations over wallets)

**Issue body (drop-in):**
Open a discussion proposing a profile that emphasizes attestations/cred systems and routes artifacts to AdviceBombs.

See `/templates/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` for a richer scaffold.

## Positioning notes
- Emphasize repo‑first, checksumed artifacts and zero lock‑in.
- Offer a tiny PR/docs-only change first; code adapters optional.
- Mention CoAudit verifiability and CoSync breadcrumbs.
