# g0v / vTaiwan community — Dossier

**GitHub org/repo:** g0v/*

## Why candidate
- World‑class civic hacking community; pioneered vTaiwan with Pol.is for consensus.
- Culturally aligned with open, repo‑first collaboration; active Slack and channels for projects.
- Bridge: vTaiwan/Pol.is outputs → AdviceBombs for municipal or ministry follow‑through.

## Who to approach
- Engage in #vtaiwan with a working adapter; ask for a small pilot with an existing conversation.
- Contacts: slack: join.g0v.tw (Slack) → #vtaiwan, person: Audrey Tang (@audreyt on GitHub/X)

## First-touch (ready-to-file)
**Issue title:** Pilot: vTaiwan Pol.is → AdviceBomb (audit‑ready)

**Issue body (drop-in):**
Offer an adapter and ask for a small pilot converting a past Pol.is convo into an AdviceBomb + CoAudit chain.

See `/templates/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` for a richer scaffold.

## Positioning notes
- Emphasize repo‑first, checksumed artifacts and zero lock‑in.
- Offer a tiny PR/docs-only change first; code adapters optional.
- Mention CoAudit verifiability and CoSync breadcrumbs.
