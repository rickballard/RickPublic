Subject: Tiny bridge: Metagov / PolicyKit → CoSuite AdviceBomb (auditable handoff)

Hi {Name or Team},

We build CoSuite (repo-first civic tech: AdviceBomb → CoAudit → narrative explainers). 
We'd love to contribute a tiny, non-disruptive "Export → AdviceBomb" bridge for Metagov / PolicyKit: 
one command that packages decisions/deliberation into a ZIP with checksums and a reproducible trail.

Why it helps you: quicker downstream action, cleaner audits for partners, and more case studies.
We’ll open a small PR/issue to propose the mapping and ship a working sample.

Would you be open to a 20‑min technical sync, or should we just file the issue with a tiny PR?

Thanks!
— Rick (CoSuite)
