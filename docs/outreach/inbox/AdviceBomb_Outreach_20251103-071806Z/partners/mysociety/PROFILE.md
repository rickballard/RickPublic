# mySociety (incl. FixMyStreet, TheyWorkForYou)  -  Dossier

**GitHub org/repo:** mysociety/*

## Why candidate
- Production‑hardened civic platforms and data pipes; strong research culture.
- Ideal to test AdviceBomb CoAudit on real civic workflows (e.g., FixMyStreet evidence bundles).

## Who to approach
- Approach Democracy/Transparency leads; propose a tiny exporter for evidence bundles.
- Contacts: email: hello@mysociety.org, email: funding@mysociety.org

## First-touch (ready-to-file)
**Issue title:** Exporter: FixMyStreet → AdviceBomb (evidence bundles)

**Issue body (drop-in):**
Add docs or plugin to export a report thread as an AdviceBomb with CoAudit‑ready checksums.

See `/templates/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` for a richer scaffold.

## Positioning notes
- Emphasize repo‑first, checksumed artifacts and zero lock‑in.
- Offer a tiny PR/docs-only change first; code adapters optional.
- Mention CoAudit verifiability and CoSync breadcrumbs.
