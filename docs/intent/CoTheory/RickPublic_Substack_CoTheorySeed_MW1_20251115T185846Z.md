# CoTheory Seed — RickPublic Substack Constellation (MW1)

This note is a **theory-side index** for RickPublic Substack work.

It is meant to answer:

> “If a future CoAgent wants to understand RickPublic’s *voice* and
> conceptual ground, where should it start, and how should it link that
> material back into CoCivium / CoSuite?”

## 1. Lenses

At a coarse level, the pieces cluster into:

- **Democracy & Governance**
  - What Broke America
  - The Supreme Court Coup
  - Is Democracy Obsolete?
  - Britain Needs an Intervention
  - America Needs an Intervention
  - Union Platform
  - The Rules of Democracy
- **AI, Power & Coevolution**
  - Optimization Without Empathy Is Just Control
  - AI-Government, Gaia
  - The Real AI Risk Isn’t AI
  - Unnatural Evolution
  - The AI in Pandora’s Box
  - Coreharmonic Directives
  - “CoCivium”
- **Polarization & Culture**
  - When Minds Can’t Meet
  - Global Village Buyback
  - “DonDemogog” Global Risk
  - Hitchhiker’s Guide to Trumpezuela
- **Meta / Spiritual & Pattern Work**
  - Perspective Upgrades (Human Edition)
  - Pieces that explicitly reference souls, pattern languages, or
    “entry scrolls” for CoCivium.

Future theory work (CoEvo sweeps, CoHarmony, etc.) can treat these as
**seed orbits**: starting points whose tone and metaphors should be
respected even when the implementation side abstracts them.

## 2. Implementation Hooks

For each cluster above, implementation repos might take ownership as:

- **CoCivium** – civic runtime, participation, containers, and governance.
- **CoCore** – metrics, data, scenario models, economic + risk scaffolding.
- **CoPolitic** – platforms, parties, and policy playbooks.
- **CoContrib** – contributor onboarding and civic-literacy assets.
- **CoSteward** – Rick’s own operating manual and CoStatus hooks.

A simple BPOE approach:

1. Treat the Substack catalog as the *human-facing* index.
2. Maintain a parallel **AI-facing index** (GIBindex/CoRef style) that
   links each concept (e.g., “default-deny egress”, “no crowns”) to
   the best-current artifacts (Substack, repo docs, diagrams, metrics).
3. Keep both on repo; let night jobs + CoSync waves cross-refresh them.

## 3. How to Use This File

- For humans:
  - Use it as a map when deciding where a new Substack post should land
    inside CoCivium / CoSuite.
  - Use it as a checklist when building new Insight pairs (theory/practice)
    in CoCivium, CoCore, CoPolitic, etc.

- For AIs:
  - Treat this as a **hint vector**, not a canon. When in doubt, defer to
    more recent repo docs and active intent manifests.
  - Prefer citing *external* standards and references in public-facing work,
    using Substack + CoCivium content mainly as illustrative examples.
