# Outreach Strategy (Cumulative) — RickPublic

**Purpose:** make Rick’s outreach/marketing easy, fast, and low‑overhead. This doc is the live, cumulative strategy for personal outreach (not org‑wide).

## 1) Objectives
- Build an *opt‑in* audience for CoSuite/CoCivium via credible, independent guardrails narrative.
- Prepare launch pathways for **CoArena** (CoAgent product surface) and **RepoZipper** without over‑committing timelines.
- Maintain independence and neutrality (no vendor exclusivity).

## 2) Phasing (futures‑first)
- **Phase 0 (Now)**: staging & playbooks; collect assets; define ICPs; decide success metrics.
- **Phase 1 (Soft signals)**: drip Substack posts; 1–2 “explain/undo” demos; small partner discovery calls.
- **Phase 2 (Pilot asks)**: 60‑day neutral guardrails pilots; measure auditability/MTTR/false‑assist deltas.
- **Phase 3 (Scale)**: public references; contributor onboarding; sponsor/partner lanes.

## 3) ICPs (initial hypotheses)
- Civic‑tech & gov digital teams; university labs; regulated enterprise teams piloting AI assist.
- Indie maintainers & small studios who want audit trails + reversible automation.
- Angel/philanthropic sponsors who value open guardrails.

## 4) Messaging pillars
1. **Edge‑owned guardrails**: explain, object, rollback — with transparent evidence.
2. **Vendor‑neutral trust**: independent layer complements (not competes with) existing assistants.
3. **Open co‑evolution**: auditable patterns anyone can adopt; community momentum over lock‑in.

## 5) Channels (owned > earned > paid)
- **Substack (RickPublic)** — cornerstone essays & progress notes.
- **GitHub** — releases, READMEs, Discussions; outreach packs as Releases.
- **LinkedIn** — calls‑for‑pilots, co‑dev notes, short clips.
- **Email** — concise pilot asks; personal updates.
- **X/Twitter** — lightweight updates; pointers to Substack/GitHub.
- (Optional later) YouTube demo shorts; podcasts.

## 6) Content plan (drip‑feed, 6–10 items)
- 2–3 “why independent guardrails” posts.
- CoArena & RepoZipper one‑pagers (+ GIF demos).
- “Explain/Undo” live demo.
- Pilot brief & case‑study skeletons.

## 7) Success metrics
- 10–20 qualified pilot leads; 3–5 pilot MoUs; ≥2 public case studies.
- Newsletter growth & reply count; demo watch‑through; inbound from GitHub Discussions.

## 8) Governance & licensing posture
- Core patterns: AGPL (or SSPL alternative); SDK/examples Apache‑2.0.
- Trademark and brand policy retained.
- Non‑exclusivity and non‑assert in any pilots.

## 9) Decision gates
- Gate A (strategy ready): structure + playbooks + demos seeded.
- Gate B (pilot ready): assets + one‑pager + demo + list of targets.
- Gate C (scale): success metrics met; co‑marketing only after wins.
