Subject: Exploring a neutral guardrails pilot (60‑day scoped)

Hi <Name>,

We’re developing **CoSuite/CoCivium** - an independent, vendor‑neutral guardrails layer that works with assistants (e.g., Copilot/agents) while remaining edge‑owned by customers. Focus: **explain/undo**, **objection windows**, **auditable evidence**.

We’d like to propose a **60‑day pilot**:
- Scope: integrate guardrails into 1–2 assistant flows.
- Outcomes: (1) explain/undo, (2) reduced unsafe/low‑trust assists, (3) exportable audit logs.
- Model: non‑exclusive; no IP transfer on our core (AGPL core, Apache SDK).

If this aligns, could we schedule a 20‑minute scoping call?

Thanks,  
Rick
