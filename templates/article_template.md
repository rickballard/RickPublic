# <punchy headline>

- One sentence that earns attention.
- One sentence that frames the 'what is happening'.
- One sentence that points to method + figure.

**DonDemogog (concise):**
- Don: gangster boss (fear, capture)
- Demogog: manipulative populist (crisis-for-power)
- DonDemogog: manufactures crisis; hijacks institutions.

**Figures**
- [World Map: DonDemogog Hot Zones](infographics/maps/<figure>.png)
- [Matrix: Resilience vs Exploitation (BCG style)](infographics/matrices/<figure>.png)

**Method Notes**
{ScripTag}
- Data sources + weights → see repo `/infographics/methods/`
- Replicable code (CSV + script) → same folder
- Caveats acknowledged briefly

**CoCivium Relevance**
- Opacity enables DonDemogogs
- Transparent, replicable models reduce their room to maneuver
