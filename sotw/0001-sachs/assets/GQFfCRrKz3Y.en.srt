that the Affordable Care Act tax credits

that the Affordable Care Act tax credits
 

413
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,189
that the Affordable Care Act tax credits
are essential, that allowing them to

are essential, that allowing them to
 

415
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,070
are essential, that allowing them to

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
expire would cause premiums to increase
 

417
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,150
expire would cause premiums to increase

by thousands of dollars for millions of

by thousands of dollars for millions of

Americans, and that this is a moral
 

421

issue that Democrats cannot compromise
 

423
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,550
issue that Democrats cannot compromise
on. I understand that argument. I've

on. I understand that argument. I've

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,710
on. I understand that argument. I've
spent much of my career advocating for

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
spent much of my career advocating for
 

427
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,189
spent much of my career advocating for
universal health care, for systems that

428
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
universal health care, for systems that
 

429
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,510
universal health care, for systems that
ensure everyone has access to medical

ensure everyone has access to medical

ensure everyone has access to medical

432
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
care regardless of their ability to pay.

care regardless of their ability to pay.
The United States is the only advanced

434
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
The United States is the only advanced
 

435
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,430
The United States is the only advanced
economy that doesn't guarantee health

436
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
economy that doesn't guarantee health
 

437
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,270
economy that doesn't guarantee health
care as a right. And the result is that

438
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
care as a right. And the result is that
 

439
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,430
care as a right. And the result is that
we spend far more per capita than any

440
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
we spend far more per capita than any
 

441
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,110
we spend far more per capita than any

other country while achieving worse

00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,749
other country while achieving worse
health outcomes. So yes, protecting

444
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
health outcomes. So yes, protecting
 

445
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,589
health outcomes. So yes, protecting
healthcare subsidies matters. But here's

446
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
healthcare subsidies matters. But here's
 

447
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,110
healthcare subsidies matters. But here's
my problem with how the Democrats are

448
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
my problem with how the Democrats are
 

449
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,550
my problem with how the Democrats are
approaching this. They're treating the

450
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
approaching this. They're treating the
 

451
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,469
approaching this. They're treating the
Affordable Care Act subsidies as if

452
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
Affordable Care Act subsidies as if
 

453
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,830
Affordable Care Act subsidies as if
they're a permanent solution to

454
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
they're a permanent solution to
 

455
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,749
they're a permanent solution to
America's health care crisis when in

456
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
America's health care crisis when in
 

457
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,350
America's health care crisis when in
reality they're a band-aid on a

458
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
reality they're a band-aid on a
 

459
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,589
reality they're a band-aid on a
fundamentally broken system. We don't

460
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
fundamentally broken system. We don't
 

461
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,430
fundamentally broken system. We don't
have a functioning healthcare market in

462
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
have a functioning healthcare market in
 

463
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,029
have a functioning healthcare market in
the United States. We have a system

464
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
the United States. We have a system
 

465
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,790
the United States. We have a system
dominated by insurance companies,

466
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
dominated by insurance companies,
 

467
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,629
dominated by insurance companies,
pharmaceutical corporations, and

468
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
pharmaceutical corporations, and
 

469
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,710
pharmaceutical corporations, and
hospital chains that extract enormous

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
hospital chains that extract enormous
 

471
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,710
hospital chains that extract enormous
profits while delivering mediocre care

profits while delivering mediocre care
 

473
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,670
profits while delivering mediocre care
at exorbitant prices. The subsidies help

474
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
at exorbitant prices. The subsidies help
 

475
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,749
at exorbitant prices. The subsidies help
people afford insurance, yes, but they

476
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
people afford insurance, yes, but they
 

477
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,149
people afford insurance, yes, but they
do nothing to address the underlying

478
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
do nothing to address the underlying
 

479
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,829
do nothing to address the underlying
cost drivers. They're essentially a

480
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
cost drivers. They're essentially a
 

481
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,750
cost drivers. They're essentially a
transfer of taxpayer money to the health

482
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
transfer of taxpayer money to the health
 

483
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,149
transfer of taxpayer money to the health
care industry. Every other advanced

484
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
care industry. Every other advanced
 

485
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,310
care industry. Every other advanced
economy has figured out how to provide

486
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
economy has figured out how to provide
 

487
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,149
economy has figured out how to provide
universal health care at a fraction of

00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
universal health care at a fraction of
 

489
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,589
universal health care at a fraction of
what we spend. They do it through

490
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
what we spend. They do it through
 

491
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,389
what we spend. They do it through
various models. Singlepayer systems like

492
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:46,399
various models. Singlepayer systems like
 

493
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,949
various models. Singlepayer systems like
in Canada and the UK, social insurance

494
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
in Canada and the UK, social insurance
 

495
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,269
in Canada and the UK, social insurance
systems like in Germany and France. But

496
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
systems like in Germany and France. But
 

497
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,030
systems like in Germany and France. But
the common thread is that they all

498

always the first things on the chopping
block when there's a budget fight. This

664
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
block when there's a budget fight. This
 

665
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,630
block when there's a budget fight. This
isn't an accident. It reflects the power

666
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
isn't an accident. It reflects the power
 

667
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,630
isn't an accident. It reflects the power
structure of American society. The

668
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
structure of American society. The
 

669
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,030
structure of American society. The
defense contractors, the security state,

670
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
defense contractors, the security state,
 

671
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,949
defense contractors, the security state,
the wealthy individuals and corporations

672
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
the wealthy individuals and corporations
 

673
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,870
the wealthy individuals and corporations
who benefit from low taxes. They have

674
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
who benefit from low taxes. They have
 

675
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,190
who benefit from low taxes. They have
enormous political influence. Working

676
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
enormous political influence. Working
 

677
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,190
enormous political influence. Working
people, the poor, the elderly, they have

678
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
people, the poor, the elderly, they have
 

679
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,750
people, the poor, the elderly, they have
much less. And you know, for those of

680
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
much less. And you know, for those of
 

681
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,910
much less. And you know, for those of
you who are my age or older who remember

682
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
you who are my age or older who remember
 

683
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,710
you who are my age or older who remember
the 1960s and 70s, I think you'll

684
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
the 1960s and 70s, I think you'll
 

685
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,710
the 1960s and 70s, I think you'll
recognize that America has changed in

686
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
recognize that America has changed in
 

687
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,030
recognize that America has changed in
fundamental ways. Back then, we had much

688
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,040
fundamental ways. Back then, we had much
 

689
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,190
fundamental ways. Back then, we had much
higher taxes on the wealthy. the top

690
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
higher taxes on the wealthy. the top
 

691
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,150
higher taxes on the wealthy. the top
marginal tax rate was 70% or more. We

692
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
marginal tax rate was 70% or more. We
 

693
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,069
marginal tax rate was 70% or more. We
had stronger unions that gave workers

694
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
had stronger unions that gave workers
 

695
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,829
had stronger unions that gave workers
real bargaining power. We had a

696
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
real bargaining power. We had a
 

697
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,629
real bargaining power. We had a
political system that uh while certainly

698
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
political system that uh while certainly
 

699
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,870
political system that uh while certainly
not perfect, was much more responsive to

700
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
not perfect, was much more responsive to
 

701
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,949
not perfect, was much more responsive to
the needs of ordinary citizens than it

702
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
the needs of ordinary citizens than it
 

703
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,590
the needs of ordinary citizens than it
is today. And as a result, we had less

704
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
is today. And as a result, we had less
 

705
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,389
is today. And as a result, we had less
inequality, stronger economic growth

706
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
inequality, stronger economic growth
 

707
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,710
inequality, stronger economic growth
that was more widely shared and a

708
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
that was more widely shared and a
 

709
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,230
that was more widely shared and a
government that actually functioned

710
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
government that actually functioned
 

711
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,629
government that actually functioned
reasonably well most of the time. What

712
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
reasonably well most of the time. What
 

713
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,629
reasonably well most of the time. What
happened? Well, starting in the 1980s

714
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
happened? Well, starting in the 1980s
 

715
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,310
happened? Well, starting in the 1980s
with the Reagan administration and

716
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
with the Reagan administration and
 

717
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,150
with the Reagan administration and
continuing through both Democratic and

718
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
continuing through both Democratic and
 

719
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,230
continuing through both Democratic and
Republican presidents. Since then, we've

720
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
Republican presidents. Since then, we've
 

721
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,150
Republican presidents. Since then, we've
had a systematic dismantling of the

722
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
had a systematic dismantling of the
 

723
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,710
had a systematic dismantling of the
institutions and policies that created

724
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
institutions and policies that created
 

725
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,710
institutions and policies that created
broadly shared prosperity. We've cut

726
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
broadly shared prosperity. We've cut
 

727
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,629
broadly shared prosperity. We've cut
taxes on the wealthy and corporations

728
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
taxes on the wealthy and corporations
 

729
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,389
taxes on the wealthy and corporations
again and again. We've weakened unions

730
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
again and again. We've weakened unions
 

731
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,389
again and again. We've weakened unions
and allowed corporations to ship jobs

732
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
and allowed corporations to ship jobs
 

733
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,710
and allowed corporations to ship jobs
overseas. We've deregulated industries

734
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
overseas. We've deregulated industries
 

735
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,470
overseas. We've deregulated industries
in ways that increase profits for

736
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
in ways that increase profits for
 

737
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,710
in ways that increase profits for
shareholders while hurting workers and

738
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
shareholders while hurting workers and
 

739
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,629
shareholders while hurting workers and
consumers. We've allowed money to flood

740
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
consumers. We've allowed money to flood
 

741
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,629
consumers. We've allowed money to flood
into politics to an extent that would

742
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
into politics to an extent that would
 

743
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,110
into politics to an extent that would
have been unimaginable 50 years ago. And

744
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
have been unimaginable 50 years ago. And
 

745
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,430
have been unimaginable 50 years ago. And
the result is that we now have levels of

746
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
the result is that we now have levels of
 

747
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,990
the result is that we now have levels of
economic inequality not seen since the

748
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
economic inequality not seen since the
 

749
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,629
economic inequality not seen since the
1920s. A political system that is

750
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
1920s. A political system that is
 

751
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,710
1920s. A political system that is
increasingly unresponsive to the needs

752
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720
increasingly unresponsive to the needs
 

753
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,110
increasingly unresponsive to the needs
of ordinary citizens and a government

754
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
of ordinary citizens and a government
 

755
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,509
of ordinary citizens and a government
that lurches from crisis to crisis,

756
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
that lurches from crisis to crisis,
 

757
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,150
that lurches from crisis to crisis,
unable to address even basic functions

758
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
unable to address even basic functions
 

759
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,389
unable to address even basic functions
like passing a budget on time. This

760
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
like passing a budget on time. This
 

761
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,470
like passing a budget on time. This
shutdown is a symptom of that broader

762
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,480
shutdown is a symptom of that broader
 

763
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,310
shutdown is a symptom of that broader
dysfunction. Both parties are more

764
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
dysfunction. Both parties are more
 

765
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,990
dysfunction. Both parties are more
interested in positioning themselves for

766
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
interested in positioning themselves for
 

767
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,670
interested in positioning themselves for
political advantage than in actually

768
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680
political advantage than in actually
 

769
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,590
political advantage than in actually
solving problems. The Republicans want

770
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
solving problems. The Republicans want
 

771
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,590
solving problems. The Republicans want
to look fiscally responsible without

772
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600
to look fiscally responsible without
 

773
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,829
to look fiscally responsible without
actually being fiscally responsible. The

774
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
actually being fiscally responsible. The
 

775
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,350
actually being fiscally responsible. The
Democrats want to look like they're

776
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
Democrats want to look like they're
 

777
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,710
Democrats want to look like they're
fighting for health care without

778
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
fighting for health care without
 

779
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,230
fighting for health care without
actually reforming the health care

780
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
actually reforming the health care
 

781
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,069
actually reforming the health care
system. And meanwhile, the American

782
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
system. And meanwhile, the American
 

783
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,790
system. And meanwhile, the American
people suffer the consequences. Federal

784
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:48,800
people suffer the consequences. Federal
 

785
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,430
people suffer the consequences. Federal
workers go without paychecks. Essential

786
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
workers go without paychecks. Essential
 

787
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,829
workers go without paychecks. Essential
services are disrupted. and the rest of

788
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
services are disrupted. and the rest of
 

789
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,470
services are disrupted. and the rest of
the world looks at the United States and

790
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
the world looks at the United States and
 

791
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,710
the world looks at the United States and
wonders what happened to the country

792
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:58,720
wonders what happened to the country
 

793
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,110
wonders what happened to the country
that used to be a model of stable

794
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,120
that used to be a model of stable
 

795
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,350
that used to be a model of stable
effective governance. Now, I want to

796
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
effective governance. Now, I want to
 

797
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,870
effective governance. Now, I want to
talk about something that I think is

798
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
talk about something that I think is
 

799
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,550
talk about something that I think is
particularly important for understanding

800
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
particularly important for understanding
 

801
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,069
particularly important for understanding
this moment and that's the broader

802
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
this moment and that's the broader
 

803
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,069
this moment and that's the broader
context of American decline. I don't say

804
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
context of American decline. I don't say
 

805
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,150
context of American decline. I don't say
that to be pessimistic or to engage in

806
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
that to be pessimistic or to engage in
 

807
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,069
that to be pessimistic or to engage in
the kind of doommongering that's become

808
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
the kind of doommongering that's become
 

809
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,069
the kind of doommongering that's become
fashionable in some circles. I say it

810
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
fashionable in some circles. I say it
 

811
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,670
fashionable in some circles. I say it
because I think we need to be cleareyed

812
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
because I think we need to be cleareyed
 

813
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,189
because I think we need to be cleareyed
about where we are and what needs to

814
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
about where we are and what needs to
 

815
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,030
about where we are and what needs to
change. The United States is still the

816
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
change. The United States is still the
 

817
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,870
change. The United States is still the
world's largest economy, still the

818
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
world's largest economy, still the
 

819
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,710
world's largest economy, still the
world's most powerful military force,

820
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720
world's most powerful military force,
 

821
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,069
world's most powerful military force,
still a center of innovation and

822
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
still a center of innovation and
 

823
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,150
still a center of innovation and
technological development, but our

824
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
technological development, but our
 

825
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,389

because of external threats, but because

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,870
because of external threats, but because
of our own choices. Uh, China's economy

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
of our own choices. Uh, China's economy

has grown to rival ours in size and is

It's because they've invested heavily in

00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
courage and compromise. What's different
 

939
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,509
courage and compromise. What's different
now? Why can't we do those things

now? Why can't we do those things
 

941
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,829
now? Why can't we do those things
anymore? Well, part of it is the rise of

both sides, though I think it's more
 

947
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,749
both sides, though I think it's more
pronounced on the Republican side in

00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
pronounced on the Republican side in
 

949
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,990
pronounced on the Republican side in
recent years. The idea that compromise

950
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
recent years. The idea that compromise
 

951
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,230
recent years. The idea that compromise
is betrayal, that working with the other

952
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,240
is betrayal, that working with the other
 

953
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,470
is betrayal, that working with the other
side is selling out, that politics is

954
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
side is selling out, that politics is
 

955
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,629
side is selling out, that politics is
war by other means. This is poison for

956
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639
war by other means. This is poison for
 

957
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,550
war by other means. This is poison for
democratic governance. Democracy

958
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
democratic governance. Democracy
 

959
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,710
democratic governance. Democracy
requires compromise. It requires the

960
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
requires compromise. It requires the
 

961
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,310
requires compromise. It requires the
ability to see the other side as

962
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,320
ability to see the other side as
 

963
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,310
ability to see the other side as
legitimate opponents rather than enemies

964
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
legitimate opponents rather than enemies
 

965
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,310
legitimate opponents rather than enemies
to be destroyed. When you lose that, you

966
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320
to be destroyed. When you lose that, you
 

967
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,870
to be destroyed. When you lose that, you
get paralysis and dysfunction. Uh but

968
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:54,880
get paralysis and dysfunction. Uh but
 

969
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,710
get paralysis and dysfunction. Uh but
there's another factor that I think is

970
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
there's another factor that I think is
 

971
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,389
there's another factor that I think is
even more important, and that's the

972
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
even more important, and that's the
 

973
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,949
even more important, and that's the
influence of money in politics. The

974
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
influence of money in politics. The
 

975
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,189
influence of money in politics. The
Citizens United decision and subsequent

976
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:03,199
Citizens United decision and subsequent
 

977
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,429
Citizens United decision and subsequent
rulings have allowed unlimited money to

978
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
rulings have allowed unlimited money to
 

979
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,669
rulings have allowed unlimited money to
flow into our political system. Wealthy

980
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
flow into our political system. Wealthy
 

981
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,429
flow into our political system. Wealthy
individuals and corporations can now

982
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
individuals and corporations can now
 

983
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,189
individuals and corporations can now
spend as much as they want to influence

984
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
spend as much as they want to influence
 

985
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,669
spend as much as they want to influence
elections and policy. And the result is

986
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
elections and policy. And the result is
 

987
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,110
elections and policy. And the result is
that politicians are much more

988
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
that politicians are much more
 

989
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,949
that politicians are much more
responsive to their donors than to their

00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
responsive to their donors than to their
 

991
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,870
responsive to their donors than to their
constituents. Both parties are guilty of

992
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:18,880
constituents. Both parties are guilty of
 

993
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,870
constituents. Both parties are guilty of
this. Democrats take money from Wall

994
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
this. Democrats take money from Wall
 

995
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,549
this. Democrats take money from Wall
Street, from tech companies, from

Street, from tech companies, from
 

997
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,789

00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799
Hollywood. Republicans take money from
 

999
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,710
Hollywood. Republicans take money from
fossil fuel companies, from defense

00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
fossil fuel companies, from defense
 

1001

1003
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,190
contractors, from wealthy individuals.
And in both cases, this money shapes

1004
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
And in both cases, this money shapes
 

1005
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,750
And in both cases, this money shapes
policy in ways that benefit the donors

1006
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
policy in ways that benefit the donors
 

1007
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,909
policy in ways that benefit the donors
rather than ordinary Americans. This is

00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
rather than ordinary Americans. This is
 

1009
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,150
rather than ordinary Americans. This is
why we can't have a rational discussion

1010
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
why we can't have a rational discussion
 

1011
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,630
why we can't have a rational discussion
about fiscal policy because a rational

about fiscal policy because a rational
 

1013
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,870
about fiscal policy because a rational
fiscal policy would involve raising

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
fiscal policy would involve raising
 

1015
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,190
fiscal policy would involve raising
taxes on the wealthy and corporations,

00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
taxes on the wealthy and corporations,
 

1017

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,909
cost controls on health care, investing
in education and infrastructure. But all

1022
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
in education and infrastructure. But all
 

1023
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,669
in education and infrastructure. But all
of those things would hurt powerful

1024
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:53,679
of those things would hurt powerful
 

1025
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,230
of those things would hurt powerful

So instead, we get theater. we get

So instead, we get theater. we get

So instead, we get theater. we get

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,270
messaging and positioning rather than
about actually solving problems. Now,

1034
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
about actually solving problems. Now,
 

1035
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,789
about actually solving problems. Now,
some people might say I'm being too

1036
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:06,799
some people might say I'm being too
 

1037
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,630
some people might say I'm being too
cynical, that I'm not giving enough

credit to the genuine policy differences
between the parties. And yes, there are

between the parties. And yes, there are

These are legitimate differences that

These are legitimate differences that

views about the role of government. But
 

1059
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,390
views about the role of government. But
here's the thing. When you look at what

1060
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
here's the thing. When you look at what
 

1061
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,390
here's the thing. When you look at what
actually happens when either party is in

actually happens when either party is in
 

1063
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,870
actually happens when either party is in
power, uh the differences are much

power, uh the differences are much
 

1065
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,549

smaller than the rhetoric suggests.

the deficit. Both parties talk about
 

1085
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,630
the deficit. Both parties talk about

00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
campaigns. This is why I've been so
 

1103
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,070

written about this extensively. When

written about this extensively. When

Trump imposed his tariff policies, which
 

1129
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,909
Trump imposed his tariff policies, which
I've described as childish and

I've described as childish and

I've described as childish and

economically illiterate, I pointed out
 

1133
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,669
economically illiterate, I pointed out
that the real problem isn't trade

1134

that the real problem isn't trade

are cheating us despite what Trump

are cheating us despite what Trump
 

1145
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,990
are cheating us despite what Trump
claims. It's because our government

1146
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,000
claims. It's because our government
 

1147
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,230
claims. It's because our government
spends far more than it takes in. And

1148
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
spends far more than it takes in. And
 

1149
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,390
spends far more than it takes in. And
that excess demand gets met through

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
that excess demand gets met through
 

1151
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,350
that excess demand gets met through

paychecks continued. Some Democrats
 

1225
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,310
paychecks continued. Some Democrats
questioned whether this was legal. And

1226
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,320
questioned whether this was legal. And
 

1227
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,750
questioned whether this was legal. And
you know what? That's actually an

00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:15,760
you know what? That's actually an
 

1229
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,990
you know what? That's actually an
important constitutional question about

1230
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
important constitutional question about

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,590
important constitutional question about
the separation of powers and

the separation of powers and

the separation of powers and
congressional control over spending. But

congressional control over spending. But
 

1235
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,190
congressional control over spending. But
here's what struck me about that debate.

here's what struck me about that debate.
 

1237
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,950
here's what struck me about that debate.
Democrats seem more concerned about the

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
Democrats seem more concerned about the
 

1239
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,110
Democrats seem more concerned about the
legality of paying troops than about the

1240
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
legality of paying troops than about the
 

1241
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,789
legality of paying troops than about the
troops not getting paid. Now, maybe

1242
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
troops not getting paid. Now, maybe
 

1243
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,710
troops not getting paid. Now, maybe
that's not entirely fair. Maybe they

1244
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
that's not entirely fair. Maybe they
 

1245
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,710
that's not entirely fair. Maybe they
were making a principled argument about

1246
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,720
were making a principled argument about
 

1247
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,870
were making a principled argument about
constitutional constraints on executive

1248
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:34,880
constitutional constraints on executive
 

1249
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,789
constitutional constraints on executive
power. And those constraints do matter.

1250
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:36,799
power. And those constraints do matter.

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,310
power. And those constraints do matter.
We don't want presidents to be able to

We don't want presidents to be able to
spend money however they want without

spend money however they want without
 

1255
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,510
spend money however they want without
congressional approval. That's an

1256
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
congressional approval. That's an
 

1257
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,590
congressional approval. That's an
important check on executive authority.

1258
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:43,600
important check on executive authority.
 

1259
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,430
important check on executive authority.

Democrats look like they cared more

Democrats look like they cared more
 

1263
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,110
Democrats look like they cared more
about procedural objections than about

1264
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
about procedural objections than about
 

1265
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,350
about procedural objections than about
military families. And this gets at

1266
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,360
military families. And this gets at
 

1267
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,789
military families. And this gets at
something I've observed throughout my

something I've observed throughout my
 

1269
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,870
something I've observed throughout my
career, which is that Democrats are

needs to happen. First, we need

00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,799
needs to happen. First, we need
 

1407
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,110
needs to happen. First, we need
fundamental campaign finance reform. We

1408
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,120
fundamental campaign finance reform. We
 

1409
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,470
fundamental campaign finance reform. We
need to get money out of politics or at

need to get money out of politics or at

probably requires a constitutional

00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,120
probably requires a constitutional

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,669

all political spending. Without this, we
 

1425
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,710
all political spending. Without this, we
can't have a democracy that's responsive

can't have a democracy that's responsive

returns us to something closer to the

returns us to something closer to the
progressive taxation we had in the mid

progressive taxation we had in the mid

1437
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,070

Capital gains should be taxed as

Capital gains should be taxed as
 

1441
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,990
Capital gains should be taxed as
ordinary income. We should have a wealth

1442
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
ordinary income. We should have a wealth
 

1443
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,909
ordinary income. We should have a wealth
tax on the very richest Americans.

Estate taxes should be much higher to

Estate taxes should be much higher to

aristocracy. And yes, we probably need
 

1451
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,110

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120
to raise some taxes on the middle class,
 

1453

need to drastically cut military

1462
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,640
need to drastically cut military
 

1463
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,310
need to drastically cut military
spending. We should close most of our

spending. We should close most of our
 

1465
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,549

government shutdown, frustrating as it
 

1641
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,310
government shutdown, frustrating as it

larger problems. Both parties share

00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:18,480
larger problems. Both parties share

parties need to change it. And that

The alternative is continued decline,
continued dysfunction, continued erosion

these are difficult topics and I've been
quite critical of both parties, but I

believe that honest, cleareyed analysis
 

1671
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,710
believe that honest, cleareyed analysis
is essential if we're going to move

00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,720
is essential if we're going to move
 

1673
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,470
is essential if we're going to move
forward. We can't solve problems we're

1674
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:48,480
forward. We can't solve problems we're
 

1675
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,310
forward. We can't solve problems we're
not willing to acknowledge and we can't

not willing to acknowledge and we can't

1679
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,510
have the future we want unless we're
willing to fight for it. I hope this has

00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:53,520
willing to fight for it. I hope this has
 

1681
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,950
willing to fight for it. I hope this has
given you some clarity about what's

1682
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
given you some clarity about what's
 

1683
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,470
given you some clarity about what's
really happening in Washington and why

00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,480
really happening in Washington and why
 

1685
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,149
really happening in Washington and why
it matters. The stakes couldn't be

it matters. The stakes couldn't be
 

1687
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,389
it matters. The stakes couldn't be
higher. Our democracy, our prosperity,

our future as a nation all depend on

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,310
our future as a nation all depend on
whether we can summon the political will

whether we can summon the political will
