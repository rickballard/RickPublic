[07:49] The United States is the only advanced economy that doesn't guarantee health

[16:25] now? Why can't we do those things
[16:25] now? Why can't we do those things anymore? Well, part of it is the rise of
[16:27] anymore? Well, part of it is the rise of

[16:56] there's another factor that I think is
[16:56] there's another factor that I think is even more important, and that's the
[16:58] even more important, and that's the
[16:58] even more important, and that's the influence of money in politics. The

[17:11] spend as much as they want to influence elections and policy. And the result is
[17:13] elections and policy. And the result is
[17:13] elections and policy. And the result is that politicians are much more
[17:15] that politicians are much more
[17:15] that politicians are much more responsive to their donors than to their
