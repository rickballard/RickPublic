## 2. Purpose

The Disclosing Party is sharing certain non-public information with the Receiving Parties for the purposes of:

- exploring potential collaboration,
- sharing strategic or conceptual work,
- considering employment, contractor or contributor relationships, and
- enabling informed, constructive dialogue.

This Agreement governs how such information is protected and ethically handled.

---

## 3. Confidential Information

"**Confidential Information**" means any non-public information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Parties, in any form, including but not limited to:

- strategy, plans, concepts, designs, narratives and frameworks;
- business models, financial or valuation information;
- product, technical or architectural information;
- brand, communications, story and naming systems;
- roadmaps, partnership or investor materials;
- any derivative notes, summaries or records created by the Receiving Parties.

Exceptions:

Confidential Information does not include information that:

1. Becomes public without breach of this Agreement.
2. Was known to the Receiving Parties prior to disclosure, as can be proven.
3. Is independently developed without use of Confidential Information.
4. Is rightfully obtained from a third party without duty of confidentiality.

All rights in Confidential Information remain with the Disclosing Party.

---

## 4. Obligations of the Receiving Parties

### 4.1 Non-Disclosure

The Receiving Parties shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, except as required by law.

### 4.2 Non-Use (Skills Travel, Structures Do Not)

The Receiving Parties will use Confidential Information only for the Purpose specified above, and not for:

- competitive advantage,
- independent exploitation,
- derivative products, services or brands, or
- personal or professional gain unrelated to the Purpose.

For clarity: the Receiving Parties remain entirely free to develop and use their own skills, general knowledge and independently developed methods. What is restricted here is the lifting, repackaging or translation of specific, non-public structures, frameworks, stories and architectures into non-aligned endeavours, or into endeavours that are materially inconsistent with the values, mission and guardrails articulated by the Disclosing Party.

### 4.3 Ethical Conduct

The Receiving Parties will:

- act in good faith,
- avoid misrepresenting the Disclosing Party or its work,
- raise concerns directly and constructively,
- avoid deliberate harm to the reputation, mission or ecosystem of the Disclosing Party.

---

## 5. Safety, Risk and Third-Party Pressure (Optional Clause)

If the work of the Disclosing Party may involve sensitive systems, controversial topics or potential scrutiny from powerful actors, the parties may include the following mutual understandings:

- The Receiving Parties acknowledge that involvement could carry reputational or professional risk in some contexts.
- The Disclosing Party does not wish to expose the Receiving Parties or their families to unnecessary risk and will respect requests for discretion and limited visibility.
- If a third party seeks or pressures the Receiving Parties for Confidential Information, the Receiving Parties will, where legally permitted, notify the Disclosing Party and cooperate to protect confidentiality.

This clause can be adapted or omitted based on context.

---

## 6. Future Collaboration, Contribution and Ownership

This Agreement:

- does not create employment, partnership or agency,
- does not guarantee future engagement, and
- does not limit the parties from entering into separate agreements.

The parties recognize that future relationships (employment, contracting, advising, volunteering) may be discussed and, if agreed, will be documented in separate contracts. This NDA supports those discussions by clarifying confidentiality expectations.

### 6.1 Definitions: Project-Aligned Contributions vs Independent Work

For the purposes of this Agreement:

- "**Project-Aligned Contributions**" means any work, ideas, writings, designs, diagrams, code, frameworks, narratives or other artifacts that:
  - are created at the request of, or in direct collaboration with, the Disclosing Party; and
  - materially depend on, or substantially incorporate, Confidential Information that is not already in the public domain.

- "**Independent Work**" means work that:
  - is conceived and developed without reliance on Confidential Information; or
  - could reasonably have been developed in the same form based solely on the Receiving Parties’ existing knowledge, public information and their own independent research.

The Receiving Parties remain the full owners of their Independent Work.

### 6.2 Ownership and Stewardship of Project-Aligned Contributions

As between the parties, the Receiving Parties agree that all rights, title and interest in and to Project-Aligned Contributions shall vest in the IP-holding entities designated by the Disclosing Party.

Those entities are understood to hold such rights:

- not merely as private property, but
- in a stewardship role, in trust-like fashion,
- for the long-term benefit of the project’s intended beneficiary community (for example, a defined user community, ecosystem or humanity at large, as specified elsewhere by the Disclosing Party).

The Receiving Parties:

- hereby assign, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all intellectual property rights in Project-Aligned Contributions to such IP-holding entities; and
- agree to sign any further reasonable documents needed to give full effect to that assignment, without additional payment beyond whatever has been agreed in separate contracts (if any).

### 6.3 License Back to the Receiving Parties for Personal Portfolios (Optional)

If the parties mutually agree in writing, the Disclosing Party may grant the Receiving Parties a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to reference certain Project-Aligned Contributions in personal portfolios or CVs, provided that:

- no Confidential Information is exposed,
- no proprietary details or internal architectures are shown, and
- the usage does not create confusion about ownership or stewardship.

Absent such written permission, Project-Aligned Contributions should not be publicly showcased.

### 6.4 Freedom to Grow and Work Elsewhere

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to:

- prevent the Receiving Parties from learning, growing, improving their skills, or working elsewhere;
- stop them from building careers in adjacent or even overlapping domains; or
- limit their ability to earn a living in good faith.

The only restriction is that they may not:

- extract, re-skin or weaponize specific, non-public knowledge and structures received as Confidential Information;
- use Confidential Information to build or support initiatives that are clearly non-aligned or materially opposed to the values, aims and safeguards articulated by the Disclosing Party.

---

## 7. Remedies, Material Damages and Enforcement

The Receiving Parties acknowledge that breach of this Agreement can cause:

- financial loss,
- reputational and relational harm,
- loss of opportunities or strategic positioning,
- dilution or distortion of key concepts and narratives.

The Disclosing Party is entitled to:

1. Seek injunctive and equitable relief to prevent or halt breaches.
2. Pursue monetary damages for all reasonably foreseeable losses.
3. Recover reasonable legal, professional and enforcement costs.

---

## 8. Return or Destruction of Materials

Upon written request, the Receiving Parties shall promptly:

- return all physical Confidential Information, or
- permanently destroy or delete all copies and derivatives, and
- confirm completion in writing.

---

## 9. Compelled Disclosure

If the Receiving Parties are required by law to disclose Confidential Information, they will, to the extent permitted:

1. Provide prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party;
2. Disclose only what is legally required;
3. Cooperate in attempts to obtain protective orders or similar measures.

---

## 10. Term and Survival

The obligations under this Agreement:

- last for **[X years]** from the Effective Date for general Confidential Information;
- may last indefinitely for key intellectual property, architectures and business models, if explicitly designated as such.

Sections relating to remedies, ownership, risk acknowledgements and governing law survive termination.

---

## 11. Governing Law

This Agreement is governed by the laws of:

The parties consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of that jurisdiction, unless agreed otherwise.
