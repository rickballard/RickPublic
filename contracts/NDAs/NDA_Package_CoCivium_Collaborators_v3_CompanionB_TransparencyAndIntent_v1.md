# NDA Package Companion B – Transparency, Intent & CoCivium Footers (v1)

**This document is a non-binding companion explainer to the NDA Package v3.**  
It is meant to show how CoCivium / CoSuite thinks about trust, collaboration,
and future evolution. It does not change the legal text of the NDA.

---

## 1. What this package is

You are receiving:

- NDA Package v3 – a short, plain-language confidentiality agreement;
- Companion B (this file) – a context and transparency note about:
  - why we use NDAs at all,
  - what kind of collaboration we are hoping to explore,
  - how this asset fits into the wider CoCivium ecosystem.

You are invited to:

- read both,
- seek legal advice if you wish,
- and decide whether you want to step into the next layer of materials.

## 2. Why there is an NDA in a pro-transparency project

CoCivium and the wider CoSuite are explicitly pro-transparency and pro-accountability.
At the same time, we are stewarding:

- early-stage architectural designs,
- governance patterns,
- capital structures,
- and 'how to keep AI and humans aligned' rails

that are not yet mature enough to be safely thrown into the wild without context.

The NDA is there to:

- give us a safe first room to talk in,
- reduce the risk of mis-use or premature copy-paste,
- allow us to share materials that might later be partially open-sourced,
- and protect work that underpins crown-jewel clusters,
  without naming or disclosing them outright.

We aim, over time, to move as much as possible from HP57_Only to
Private_RepoOnly, and from there into Public_Harden and Public_OK
tiers as we gain confidence.

## 3. What this package does not do

NDA Package v3 is not intended to:

- silence you about your own life, work, or ethics;
- prevent you from using general skills and experience in your career;
- force you into any particular political, commercial, or theological stance;
- restrict any rights you already have under law (including whistleblower and
  public-interest protections, where applicable).

It is focused narrowly on:

- non-public information we share with you in the CoCivium / CoSuite context,
- and how that information is handled.

If anything in practice feels broader than that, we want to know so that
we can fix the design.

---

## 4. How we hope you will read this

We would like you to read the NDA Package v3 and this Companion B as:

- an invitation into a long-term civic project,
- not a gotcha or trap,
- and not a one-sided rights grab.

Once you are under NDA, we intend to share a layered set of materials, for example:

- an orientation brief tailored to your role,
- a view on how CoCivium sees hybrid human–AI society,
- specific questions where your expertise could stress-test our thinking,
- and options for how you might engage (with or without payment).

## 5. CoCivium-style asset footer

To make this document an exemplar CoCivium asset, we include a compact
intent and metadata footer. This is not a legal clause set; it is
a human-and-AI readable snapshot of how this asset is meant to behave
in the wider ecosystem.

  "Model post-capitalist-but-pro-investment thinking",
  "Keep humans and AIs honest about what is being asked"

6. How this connects to CoMeta / CoIndex / CoGbx

Internally, this asset is also a training exemplar for:

CoMetaTrain flows (how meta-documents and governance patterns evolve),

CoIndex and GIBindex (how we tag and discover concepts),

CoGbx-style bundles (how we package coherent stacks of material for
humans and AIs to explore together).

In practice, this means that over time we may:

update the footer,

add more structured metadata,

and publish public-facing explanations that are derived from, but less
sensitive than, the internal materials you are seeing.

7. If you have questions or objections

If anything here feels uncomfortable, unclear, or misaligned with your own
ethics or constraints, we would much rather hear that up front.

You can:

reply directly to the sender, or

email: contact@InSeed.com

We may or may not be able to adjust every detail, but your feedback helps
us evolve a better, fairer pattern for future collaborators.

This Companion B has no legal effect on its own. In any conflict between
this explainer and the NDA Package v3, the NDA text controls. However, we
will treat this Companion B as a public promise about the spirit in which
we intend to use that NDA.
