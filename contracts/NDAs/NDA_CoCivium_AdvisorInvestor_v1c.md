## 1. Purpose
The Parties wish to explore a potential advisory and investment relationship in relation to the CoCivium and related initiatives, including preliminary assessment of business models, governance structures, and potential roles for the Advisor / Investor. In the course of these discussions, each Party may disclose to the other certain confidential, sensitive, or proprietary information, collectively the “Purpose”.
This Agreement sets out the terms under which such information will be shared and protected.

## 2. Definition of Confidential Information
“Confidential Information” means any non-public information disclosed by either Party to the other Party, directly or indirectly, in any form (oral, written, electronic, visual, or otherwise), including but not limited to:
- Business plans, strategies, roadmaps, and financial projections  
- Technical architectures, algorithms, source code, schemas, and process designs  
- Product concepts, research, experiments, and non-public documentation  
- Names or identities of partners, contributors, or collaborators not yet public  
- Legal, governance, or IP strategies, including patent-related materials  
- Any notes, summaries, or derivatives created from the above
Confidential Information does **not** include information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate:
1. Was already rightfully known to the Receiving Party without restriction before disclosure;  
2. Becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party;  
3. Is rightfully received from a third party without confidentiality obligations; or  
4. Is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.
---
## 3. Obligations of the Receiving Party
Each Party, when acting as a **Receiving Party**, shall:
1. Use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose described in Section 1 (the “Purpose”).  
2. Not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, except to:  
   - Employees, partners, or advisors who have a **need to know** for the Purpose, and  
   - Who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as this Agreement.  
3. Exercise at least reasonable care (and no less than the care it uses to protect its own comparable confidential information) to protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure.  
4. Promptly notify the Disclosing Party if the Receiving Party becomes aware of any actual or suspected unauthorized use or disclosure.
---
## 4. Permitted Disclosures
If the Receiving Party is required by law, regulation, or court order to disclose any Confidential Information, it may do so **provided that**:
- It gives prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party (where legally permitted), and  
- It cooperates reasonably with the Disclosing Party in seeking protective measures or narrowing the scope of the required disclosure.
---
## 5. No License, No Obligation
Nothing in this Agreement:
- Grants any license or rights, by implication or otherwise, to any intellectual property of either Party, or  
- Obligates either Party to proceed with any proposed transaction, investment, or collaboration.
Any formal relationship (e.g., investment, advisory role, employment, or services) shall be documented under separate written agreements.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Advisor / Investor shall not use the Confidential Information to trade in any securities, or to advise others to trade, in a manner that would be inconsistent with applicable securities, insider-trading, or market-abuse laws.
---
## 6. Term and Survival
- This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for **five (5) years**, unless terminated earlier by either Party upon thirty (30) days’ written notice.  
- The confidentiality obligations shall survive for **five (5) years** after termination of this Agreement or until the Confidential Information lawfully enters the public domain, whichever is earlier.  
For trade secrets, obligations shall continue for as long as such information remains a trade secret under applicable law.
---
## 7. Return or Destruction
Upon written request from the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall, within a reasonable time:
- Return or destroy all copies of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information within its possession or control, and  
- Confirm such destruction in writing, except to the extent retention is required by law or by standard backup/archival practices (in which case the retained copies remain subject to this Agreement).
---
## 8. Remedies
The Parties acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm.  
The Disclosing Party is entitled, in addition to any other remedies available at law, to seek injunctive or equitable relief to prevent or limit any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement.
---
## 9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of **Ontario, Canada**, without regard to its conflict of law principles.  
The Parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ontario for any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.
---
## 10. Miscellaneous
- This Agreement is the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings, whether written or oral.  
- Any amendments must be in writing and signed by both Parties.  
- If any provision is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.  
- Neither Party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that either Party may assign it to a successor in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets.
