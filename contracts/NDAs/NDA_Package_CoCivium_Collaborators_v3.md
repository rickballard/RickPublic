---

## 1. Purpose

The Parties wish to explore one or more of:

- potential advisory or stewardship roles,  
- the provision of paid services,  
- voluntary collaboration or contribution to CoCivium / CoSuite and related initiatives.

To do this, Discloser may share information that is not public. This Agreement describes how that information can and cannot be used.

This is intended as a plain-language NDA. It is not meant to take away any of your pre-existing rights; it is meant to protect clearly identified confidential information that you receive from Discloser in connection with CoCivium / CoSuite.

---

## 2. What counts as Confidential Information

'Confidential Information' means any non-public information that:

1. is marked or described as confidential, or  
2. a reasonable person would understand to be confidential given its nature and the context of disclosure.

This may include, for example:

- strategy documents, roadmaps, business plans,  
- architectural notes, governance frameworks and meta-design,  
- draft contracts, investor packs, and legal structures,  
- unpublished research, analysis, and design work,  
- technical details of CoCivium / CoSuite and related systems,  
- information labelled as 'Private_RepoOnly', 'HP57_Only', or similar.

Confidential Information does not include information that:

- is or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement,  
- was already lawfully known to Recipient before disclosure,  
- is independently developed by Recipient without use of Confidential Information, or  
- is rightfully received from a third party without a duty of confidentiality.

If Recipient believes particular information falls into one of these exceptions, they will act in good faith and, where practical, confirm with Discloser before relying on the exception.

---

## 3. How Confidential Information may be used

Recipient may use Confidential Information only to:

- evaluate potential engagement with Discloser, and  
- perform agreed advisory, collaborative, or contracted work for Discloser.

Recipient will:

- not use Confidential Information for any competing or adverse purpose, and  
- not attempt to reverse engineer, reconstruct, or commercialise the confidential architecture or governance structures outside the relationship with Discloser.

If Recipient wishes to use any portion of the material for other purposes, this must be agreed in writing with Discloser in advance.

---

## 4. Protection and non-disclosure

Recipient will:

1. protect Confidential Information with at least the same care it uses for its own confidential information, and no less than reasonable care;  
2. not disclose Confidential Information to anyone except:
   - individuals within Recipient’s organisation who need to know for the Purpose and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as this Agreement, or  
   - Recipient’s professional advisors (such as lawyers), also bound by confidentiality;  
3. promptly notify Discloser if Recipient becomes aware of:
   - any unauthorised use or disclosure, or  
   - any legal demand (such as a subpoena) that might require disclosure of Confidential Information.

If disclosure is required by law or court order, Recipient will (where lawful):

- notify Discloser promptly so that Discloser can seek protection, and  
- disclose only what is legally required.

---

## 5. No assignment of IP or rights (unless agreed separately)

Except as explicitly agreed in a separate written contract:

- this Agreement does not transfer ownership of any intellectual property;  
- each Party keeps ownership of its own pre-existing material;  
- new creations, deliverables, or inventions will be covered by a separate agreement (for example, a services contract, consulting agreement, or contributor licence), to be agreed if and when needed.

Recipient may not claim, register, or assert ownership over Discloser’s confidential architectures, brands, or governance designs.

---

## 6. Duration

Confidentiality obligations begin on the Effective Date and continue for five (5) years after:

- the later of (a) the Effective Date, or (b) the last disclosure of Confidential Information under this Agreement.

If applicable law requires a different period for specific classes of information (for example, personal data), that legal requirement controls for that class.

Where particular information clearly remains sensitive beyond five years (for example, certain security or governance designs), the Parties may explicitly extend confidentiality in writing.

---

## 7. No restriction on career, general knowledge, or ethics

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to:

- limit Recipient’s right to work, speak, or act according to personal conscience or professional duties;  
- prevent Recipient from using general skills, knowledge, and experience gained over a career;  
- silence Recipient about public interest concerns that are protected by law (for example, whistleblower rights where applicable).

This Agreement only restricts the use and disclosure of identified Confidential Information as defined above.

---

## 8. Return or destruction

Upon Discloser’s written request, or upon termination of discussions or collaboration, Recipient will:

- stop actively using Confidential Information, and  
- either:
  - return it (where practical), or  
  - securely destroy it and confirm destruction in writing.

Recipient may keep one archival copy where required by law, professional rules, or reasonable internal compliance policies, provided that copy remains subject to this Agreement.

---

## 9. Remedies

Recipient acknowledges that unauthorised disclosure or misuse of Confidential Information may cause harm that is difficult to measure.

Discloser may seek appropriate remedies available at law or in equity, which may include:

- injunctive relief (a court order to stop misuse), and  
- damages, where proven.

Nothing in this Agreement obliges any Party to proceed with a particular transaction, project, or engagement.

---

## 10. Investors, advisors, and special cohorts

Where Recipient is acting as:

- an investor or potential investor,  
- a strategic advisor,  
- or part of an advisory or stewardship cohort,

additional terms (for example, around conflicts, fiduciary duties, or stewardship roles) may be set out in separate documents. Those documents will work alongside this Agreement and may extend or refine certain obligations, but will not reduce the baseline confidentiality protections set out here.

---

## 11. Governing law and venue

Unless the Parties agree otherwise in writing:

- This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada (without regard to conflict-of-law principles).  
- Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ontario, Canada.

The Parties are free to agree to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms (for example, mediation or arbitration) in a separate written document.

---

## 12. Entire agreement; amendments; counterparts

- This Agreement is the entire understanding between the Parties relating to the treatment of Confidential Information for the Purpose described above.  
- Any amendments must be in writing and signed (including via electronic signature) by both Parties.  
- This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including electronically), which together form one agreement.
