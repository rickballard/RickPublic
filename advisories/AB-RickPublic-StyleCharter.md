# AB-RickPublic-StyleCharter

**Voice:** Sharp, congruence-minded, minimal snark, never tribal. Always add net value (insight, evidence, humor, or inspiration).

**Story layout:**
- **InfoOps Headline** (as-is, styled loud). No quotation marks.
- **Reframe â†’** up to 3 bullets.
- **Congruence Halo** (CoCivium R/A/G).

**Bullets must do at least one:**
- Reveal a missing premise or incentive.
- Compress a non-obvious fact.
- Offer a wiser frame (power, ethics, economics).
- Land a clean, harmless joke that deflates the manipulation.

**Hard limits:**
- No ad hominem, no doxxing, no medical/financial instructions.
- No bullet sprawl. Prefer clarity over completeness.
- Always include at least two receipts in Real Story.
