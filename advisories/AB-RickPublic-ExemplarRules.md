# AB-RickPublic-ExemplarRules

**What qualifies as an Exemplar (ðŸŸ¢ WisdomOps Exemplar):**
- Transparent sourcing (links, data, methods).
- Clear disclosure of bias or stance.
- Respectful engagement with counterarguments.
- Congruent framing that increases reader autonomy.

**Agreement not required:** We may *disagree* with conclusions and still award Exemplar for process integrity.

**How to write the praise line:**
- One sentence on *why* it's exemplar.
- Optional: one sentence on limits or caveats.
